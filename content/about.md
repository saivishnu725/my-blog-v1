there isn't much else to say.
I really enjoy the beach, sunsets, staring at my wallpapers as well as my wall / ceiling. I am a bit quirky and weird but I am also a very nice person (hopefully).

I am also a very big fan of the _The Office_ and _Modern Family_ so if you are too, we can be friends.

I've recently taken interest into low-level programming and I intend to contribute to the Linux Kernel some day. So if you are experienced in this process, do help me get started by sharing appropriate resources and advices.
