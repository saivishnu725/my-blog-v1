This is the first post of the blog site. This is to make sure that I get familiar with the content management format.

Here is a list with basically no information in it:

* First item
* Not the first item
* Third item (i guess. I am not good with numbers)
* An ordered sublist with basically more useless information
	1. First sub-item
	2. Another sub-item
